Note: The included tools are for educational purposes only, do not use anything
included here for actual crypto purposes.

The tools here were used in the making of the ctf RSA challenges.

the factorRsa program can be used to factor large RSA keys whose
primes were chosen too closely together.

the primenumber generates prime numbers that are close together for use in the challenge

The other program is an RSA program. Complete with generating keys, encrypting, and decrypting.
It's a good way to see how some of the algorithms work, from the RSA basics, to primality testing,
to fast exponentiation, etc. Again, DO NOT USE FOR ACTUAL CRYPTO. messages are not padded, the RNG
is not cryptographically secure, etc, etc, etc.
