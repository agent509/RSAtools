included here for actual crypto purposes.

The tools here were used in the making of the ctf RSA challenges.

the factorRSA program can be used to factor large RSA keys whose
primes were chosen too closely together.

The other program is effectively a full suite, including functions
for primality testing, RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption.
